## My Opinion to movie named Wall-E

I trully as in trully do lly *Love* Wall-E movie. This movie makes or melt my heart without even noticing it especially when Wall-E memories got wipe 
and seeing Eve unfatohmly sad. I felt sad and start **Manly** cried at that scene. I wonder why but I can see why I **Manly** Cried about that scene as If
I ever got Dimentia and lose the memories of people I love, I can't even think how heart shattering it would be.
